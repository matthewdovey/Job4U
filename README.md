# Job4U

This in a iOS app that allows companies and individuals looking to advertise or acquire part time work flexible to them. This project helps to prove my Objective C knowledge and flexibility with languages I have not had huge experience with. I will also be using this project to improve my knowledge with different architectural patterns and will do so without the comfort of the storyboard.

Items marked with the (Future) tag are features and patterns that I plan to use in the future but have not yet implemented.

## Architectural Patterns Used

* MVVM (Model-View-Viewmodel)
* Coordinator Pattern
* Child View Controllers
* Built without storyboard

## Built With

* Carthage Dependency Manager
* Firebase Analytics / Crashlytics (Future)
* Snapkit

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this project, although this is for demonstrative purposes and will most likely not be placed onto the app store.
